# CORE Code Repository

Welcome to the CORE Code Repository, the Comprehensive Open Roleplay Engine (CORE) development hub. CORE is a modular, skill-based tabletop RPG system designed to provide flexibility, depth, and customization for players and game masters alike. This repository is the foundation for implementing, testing, and expanding CORE mechanics in a digital environment.

---

## Overview

The CORE RPG system uses a simple yet versatile 3d6 roll mechanic, with additional features like boons, banes, and skill modifiers. This repository is structured to facilitate the development of COREâ€™s mechanics and utilities, separating reusable logic from application-specific implementations.

---

## Project Structure

- **Core**:
  - A static library containing the core mechanics of the RPG system.
  - Includes features like:
    - Dice-rolling logic (e.g., boons and banes).
    - Configurable mechanics for skills and abilities.
    - Utilities for randomization and probability calculations.

- **App**:
  - An executable project that links against the Core static library.
  - Provides tools for testing mechanics, simulating scenarios, or prototyping new features.

- **Vendor**:
  - Third-party dependencies, including Premake binaries for build generation.

- **Scripts**:
  - Build setup scripts for Windows and Linux platforms.

## Getting Started

### Cloning the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/WayneBuschmeyer/CoreCode.git
cd CoreCode
```

### Generating Project Files

Navigate to the `Scripts` directory and run the appropriate setup script:

- **Windows**:
  ```cmd
  Setup-Windows.bat
  ```
- **Linux**:
  ```bash
  ./Setup-Linux.sh
  ```

This will generate Visual Studio (Windows) or Makefiles (Linux) project files. For macOS, duplicate and modify the Linux script as needed.

### Building the Project

1. Open the generated project/solution in your IDE or build system.
2. Build the `Core` static library.
3. Build and run the `App` executable.

## Features

### CORE Mechanics

- **3d6 Roll Mechanic**:
  - The foundation of CORE features skill modifiers, boons, and banes.
  - Additional dice rolls can adjust outcomes dynamically, enhancing gameplay.

- **Boons and Banes**:
  - Boons add extra rolls, selecting the best results.
  - Banes add extra rolls, selecting the worst results.

- **Skill Modifiers**:
  - Configurable modifiers for skills and abilities are fully integrated with the roll mechanic.

- **Flexibility**:
  - Mechanics are designed to be modular and adaptable, making it easy to extend or customize rules.

### Modular Design

The Core/App architecture separates reusable mechanics from application-specific logic, allowing:
- Easy reuse of mechanics across multiple tools or applications.
- Clear separation of concerns for better maintainability.

---

## Customization

- **Core Module**:
  - Add or modify mechanics in the Core library to implement your own rules or features.
  - Extend dice-rolling functions, skills, or abilities as needed.

- **App Module**:
  - Use the App project to test game scenarios, prototype new mechanics, or create interactive tools for CORE RPG.

- **Build Scripts**:
  - Customize the build scripts in `Build.lua`, `Core/Build-Core.lua`, and `App/Build-App.lua` to suit your needs.

---

## Roadmap

- **Automated Testing**:
  - Add comprehensive unit tests for all mechanics in the Core module.
  - Validate boons, banes, and custom mechanics under various conditions.

- **Scenario Simulators**:
  - Develop tools for simulating in-game scenarios to aid in balancing and playtesting.

- **Digital Prototypes**:
  - Create interactive tools to assist players and game masters during gameplay.

- **Cross-Platform Support**:
  - Expand support for macOS and other build systems.
